# basicBankAccount
basic bank account simulation (OOP practice)

code simulates a bank account object in python, however, it was purposely made to be basic. If I were to improve the code and make it more comples, so that
it could be universally implemented, I would use object inheritance.

Object Inheritance:
The "BankAccount" class would be the upper class
I would create sub-classes that mimic specific account classificaitons (savings, checking, CD, etc)
